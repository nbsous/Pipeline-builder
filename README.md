# Pipeline builder
makefile and resources to build monolithic WDL-based pipelines for NGS analysis.

### Needs description
Standalone methods for data processing which can be replicated easily on
multiple platforms including the University of Oslo Sensitive Data Services
[TSD](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/sensitive-data/)
which are isolated from the internet.  

Initial test setup avoiding Docker for now. The final product will be containerized in the future.
